Hi 👋,

I'm Buggsy and I've been in the blockchain security space since 2024. i've always had passion for the crypto space and decided to take the road for security researcher .



Skills
Area	Details
Solidity / EVM	I've already audited handful of protocols of various types. 

Contests
These are my results from competitions I've participated as part of a team.
the audits were a shared effort and its hard to pinpoint which findings belong to whom ,
these are the findings that i consider i have founded on my own .
